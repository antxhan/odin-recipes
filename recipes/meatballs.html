    <p>Here's how to make it.</p>
    <h2>Ingredients</h2>
    <ul>
      <li>1 pound ground beef</li>
      <li>½ pound ground veal</li>
      <li>½ pound ground pork</li>
      <li>1 cup freshly grated Romano cheese</li>
      <li>2 eggs</li>
      <li>2 cloves garlic, minced</li>
      <li>1 ½ tablespoons chopped Italian flat leaf parsley</li>
      <li>Salt and ground black pepper to taste</li>
      <li>2 cups stale Italian bread, crumbled</li>
      <li>1 ½ cups lukewarm water</li>
      <li>1 cup olive oil</li>
    </ul>

    <h2>Steps</h2>
    <ol>
      <li>Gather all ingredients.</li>
      <li>
        Combine beef, veal, and pork in a large bowl. Mix in cheese, eggs,
        garlic, parsley, salt, and pepper.
      </li>
      <li>
        Add bread crumbs and slowly mix in water, 1/2 cup at a time, until
        mixture is moist but still holds its shape (I usually use about 1 1/4
        cups of water); shape into meatballs.
      </li>
      <li>
        Heat olive oil in a large skillet; add meatballs in batches and cook
        until browned on all sides, slightly crisp, and cooked through, about 10
        to 15 minutes. Drain on paper towels.
      </li>
      <li>Enjoy!</li>
